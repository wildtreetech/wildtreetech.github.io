stages:
- title: Getting Started
  description: Let's start at the beginning. We examine different types of machine-learning problems and what the available tools are. If you can not measure how well your algorithm works you can't improve it. We will look at cross-validation, performance metrics and common mistakes. If you can not measure how well your algorithm works you can't improve it. We will look at cross-validation, performance metrics and common mistakes.
  duration: 60

- title: Measuring Performance

- title: Random Forests and gradient boosting
  description: For real world, business data it is hard to beat random forest or gradient boosted tree models. They regularly take top spot in Kaggle competitions. In this module we will dive into tree based models. Their strengths, weaknesses and some tricks of the trade to make them work really well.
  duration: 180

- title: Neural networks and deep learning
  description: Neural networks are the foundation of the current deep learning and AI resurgence. They rule supreme when it comes to image classification and object detection. In addition most state of the art models for sound and natural language understanding are based on neural networks. We will venture into the field of deep learning and its applications to image classification, object detection and image segmentation.
  duration: 180

- title: Interpretable decisions and debugging
  description: Most machine-learning are seen as black-box decision makers. In large part because the tools and techniques for looking inside are not as well known as they should be. In this module we will learn about techniques like LIME and partial dependence plots. We will apply them to neural networks and tree based ensembles to debug our models and generate explanations for customers.
  duration: 180

- title: Closing
  description: Recap of what you learned and pointers to resources to keep learning. Stay afterwards for an informal chat and networking.
