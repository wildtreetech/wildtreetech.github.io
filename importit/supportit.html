          <h3>Dilemma</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Open-source libraries are at the foundation of the modern software world. In particular for data-science and machine-learning. However projects are often maintained by only a handful of individuals and slow in responding to the needs of business users. This leaves businesses that blindly rely on open-source in a risky position.</p>
