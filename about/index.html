          <h3>Open Source</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>Wild Tree Tech loves open source. Not only do we use it to implement our client's projects, we have also created and actively contribute to some of the most advanced projects in the PyData ecosystem. These projects include <a href="http://mybinder.org">mybinder.org</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub">JupyterHub</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize">scikit-optimize</a>.</p>
          <p>By being part of large, international, and open communities we have a lot of experience managing diverse teams at scale and have insight to the trends of tomorrow.</p>
          <p>Using open source products means client projects have a solid foundation, benefit from the development of new ideas, and are not locked in to a particular vendor.</p>
